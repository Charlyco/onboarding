# Learning in public

This is an experiment.  On May 1, 2024, I said I was willing to help.  Eunice was ready to learn.
I had an idea of how I could help.  Eunice agreed to take a chance.
I had some conventions in my head. I had infrastructure and code mostly ready to go, from the work I do while streaming and practicing.
Eunice asked me "Why are you doing this for free, what's in it for you?"

"Lift as we climb!"

In order to make this more successful, I figured that we should document the journey.
I'm doing the onboarding for Eunice, and Eunice will do the onboarding for the next person, and that will continue as needed.

It starts here. This is how things are going to work from here forward.

## So what is it?

I'm providing a "platform" for you to deploy your Spring Boot applications.
My platform is built with "Raspberry Pi" devices, which are ARM64 single board computers (SBC).
I'll provide the things, that software engineers get from their platform teams, in the enterprise, but with "homelab grade" service level agreements (SLA).
We will learn together.

## What do I do?

- You have to show up for the community
- You will have to submit a "pull request" first, updating the Bootiful list below.
- The you will wait to get chosen for onboarding.
- Onboarding is at the discretion of the person doing the onboarding.
